# System-Health-Monitoring-Script
Developing a script that monitors the health of a Linux system. It should check
CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and running processes. If any of
these metrics exceed predefined thresholds (e.g., CPU usage > 80%), the
script should send an alert to the console or a log file.


 # Automated Backup Solution:
Write a script to automate the backup of a specified directory to a remote
server or a cloud storage solution. The script should provide a report on the
success or failure of the backup operation.
